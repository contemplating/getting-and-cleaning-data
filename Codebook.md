# Codebook for the file activity_subject.csv

The file contains the average of the measurements of movement tracking devices.

Variables:

1. subject - the ID of the subject^. Its range is from 1 to 30.
2. activity - the activity the sibject was engaged in during the measurements
3. body.acc.x - the average of the body acceleration signals in the X direction (standard gravity units 'g')
4. body.acc.y - the average of the body acceleration signals in the Y direction (standard gravity units 'g')
5. body.acc.z - the average of the body acceleration signals in the Z direction (standard gravity units 'g')
6. body.gyro.x - the average angular velocity in the X direction (radians/second)
7. body.gyro.y - the average angular velocity in the Y direction (radians/second)
8. body.gyro.z - the average angular velocity in the Z direction (radians/second)
9. total.acc.x - the average of the total acceleration signals in the X direction (standard gravity units 'g')
10. total.acc.y - the average of the total acceleration signals in the Y direction (standard gravity units 'g')
11. total.acc.z - the average of the total acceleration signals in the Z direction (standard gravity units 'g')
