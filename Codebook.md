# Codebook for the file activity_subject.csv

The data is a summary of the results of an experiment that measures the output of smartphone movement detection devices.

(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 

This data contain the average of measurents, grouped by subject and activity 

Variables:

1. subject - the ID of the subject. Its range is from 1 to 30.
2. activity - the activity the subject was engaged in during the measurements
3. body.acc.x - the average of the body acceleration signals in the X direction (standard gravity units 'g')
4. body.acc.y - the average of the body acceleration signals in the Y direction (standard gravity units 'g')
5. body.acc.z - the average of the body acceleration signals in the Z direction (standard gravity units 'g')
6. body.gyro.x - the average angular velocity in the X direction (radians/second)
7. body.gyro.y - the average angular velocity in the Y direction (radians/second)
8. body.gyro.z - the average angular velocity in the Z direction (radians/second)
9. total.acc.x - the average of the total acceleration signals in the X direction (standard gravity units 'g')
10. total.acc.y - the average of the total acceleration signals in the Y direction (standard gravity units 'g')
11. total.acc.z - the average of the total acceleration signals in the Z direction (standard gravity units 'g')
